# Single Responsibility Principle

> A class should have just one reason to change.

The real problems emerge when your program constantly grows and changes. 
At some point classes become so big that you can no longer remember their 
details. Code navigation slows down to a crawl, and you have to scan through 
whole classes or even an entire program to find specific things. 
The number of entities in program overflows your brain stack, 
and you feel that you’re losing control over the code.

If you feel that it’s becoming hard to focus on specific aspects of the 
program one at a time, remember the single responsibility principle and 
check whether it’s time to divide some classes into parts.
