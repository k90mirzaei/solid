# SOLID Principles

SOLID As Robert Martin introduced them in the book
[_Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices_](https://refactoring.guru/principles-book) is five
design principles intended to make software design more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

## Single Responsibility Principles

> A class should have just one reason to change.

## Open/Closed Principle

> Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

> When extending a class, remember that you should be
able to pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of
the parent class without breaking the client code.

## Interface Segregation Principle

> Clients shouldnâ€™t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
