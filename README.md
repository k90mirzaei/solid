# SOLID Principles

SOLID As Robert Martin introduced them in the book
[_Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices_](https://refactoring.guru/principles-book) is five
design principles intended to make software design more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

## Single Responsibility Principles

> A class should have just one reason to change.

## Open/Closed Principle

> Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
